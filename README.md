# MyFirstPythonProgram
 This was the first program that I made in Python. I have always been fascinated by coding and have always tried to be the best i can be. This simple Text Based RPG was the first program that I could conjure up and it was part of the building blocks to the passion that I have today.

 I am currently all self taught by trial and error / Youtube videos. I try to take in as much information as possible and an always ready to learn a new part of my programming skill. I am open to new ideas of how to do things, like a shoter way to get around a problem, or even a new solution entirely.
